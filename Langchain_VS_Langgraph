Langchain is an opensource library designed to simplify the process of building LLM based Applications

it provides some Core concept to build GEN AI Application:

1)Model : components gives use a unified interface to interact with various LLM providers
2)Prompts : Component used for giving instruction to the AI
3)Tools : Tools are used to give AI an External info like API,some Weather Data etc.
4)Memory : Memory is used by AI to remember past Chat there is kinds of memory (we will discuss later)
5)Chains : Chain are used to make linear workflows use can combine things using langchain

What You can do with Langchain:
1)Simple Conversational Workflows like Chatbot , Text Summarizers
2)Multi step Workflows
3)Agents(Basic)
4)RAG Applications



Langgraph is an orchestration that enables you to build stateful ,multistep and event driven worflows using LLMS.

There is Four Main components:
1)nodes:In LangGraph, nodes are Python functions They work like steps
2)edges:Edges are used to connect Nodes determine which node run to when
3)graph: graph is the visualization of nodes andedges
4)state: the State is a shared, mutable data structure It defines the schema of information passed between nodes


When To use which:
use langchain when you want to build simple , linear Workflows like summarizers


use Langgraph when when your use case involves complex,non-lenear Workflows that need:
1)Conditional Path
2)loop
3)HITL(Human in the loop)
4)Multi Agent Coordination

LangGraph is very low-level, and focused entirely on agent orchestration. 
Before using LangGraph, we recommend you familiarize yourself with some of the components used to build agents, starting with **models and tools**.

We will commonly use ** LangChain ** components

LangGraph is an open-source framework by LangChain designed to build complex, stateful, and agentic AI applications by modeling workflows as graphs. 
Unlike linear chains, it enables loops, branching, and persistent state management, making it ideal for multi-agent systems and long-running tasks. 
Key features include streaming updates, human-in-the-loop support, and enhanced control flow for reliable, production-ready AI. 

LangGraph is used to build complex, reliable, and stateful AI agents by enabling cyclical graphs (loops) and persistent memory, 
which are difficult to achieve with traditional linear LLM chains(Langchain).
